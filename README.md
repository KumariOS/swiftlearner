# SAIML: Scala AI and ML library

This is a hobby project that does not intend to compete with the mainstream libraries on features or performance.

It includes some examples which might be useful if you are learning the algorithms, or want to start your own implementation.

Think of it more as a cookbook.

If you want to read the library name aloud, try "say-mel" :)
